⚡ Hey there ⚡ Welcome to Jackson (Zhen Lei/雷震) Page!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Architecture 🧱 at Southeast University, specializing in environmental building design and research. My work focuses on building environmental performance optimization and green low-carbon architectural design.

I hold dual Master's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania 🏫 and Southeast University 🏛️ and a Bachelor’s degree from Chongqing University ⛰️.

With a multidisciplinary background bridging environment 🌦️, energy 🔥, and ecology 🌿 in the architectural field, I am dedicated to developing innovative approaches for energy-efficient and climate-adaptive built environments.
