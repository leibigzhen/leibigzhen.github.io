  title={Effectiveness and Optimization of Passive Design for Climate Adaptation in the HSCW Zone—Taking a High-Rise Apartment Retrofit in Philadelphia as an Example},
  author={Lei, Zhen and Zhang*, Tong and Fang, Yue},
  abstract={For architectural design to actualize climate adaptation, it is essential to optimize building energy efficiency, emission reduction, and passive survivability. However, passive design strategies for building retrofit in the hot summer and cold winter (HSCW) zone are limited in current building energy simulation and optimization (BESO) studies, which have not been widely applied in architectural practice due to the lack of a unified standard. This paper aims to explore the effectiveness and optimization methods of passive design for the typical high-rise apartment retrofit in Philadelphia, considering the dynamic effects of energy consumption, thermal comfort, and future climate scenarios. In this study, the developed future weather files were used to plot the Givoni bioclimatic chart (GBC), and building datasets were constructed based on the EnergyPlus model simulation. Meanwhile, the optimal solutions are realized based on the Morris sensitivity analysis (SA) and NSGA-II method. The results indicate solar protection remains the most effective passive design strategy, especially for south-facing room units, while the cooling effect of natural ventilation by window opening will significantly decrease over time. It is expected that in the future, the thermal coefficient (TC) of the wall and window will increase the effectiveness of energy efficiency to 235% and 152% respectively. The combinations of passive parameters in various climatic scenarios for the overall high-rise apartment retrofit can reduce both heating and cooling loads by up to 50%, and improve the duration of passive survivability by over 400 h.},

  title={Evaluating Block Energy Consumption by Integrating Urban Environmental Features using Multimodal Deep Learning Model},
  author={Xie, Yuchen and Qin, Yuchen and Chen, Kaifan and Lei, Zhen and Deng, Zixuan and Wang, Minghao},
  abstract={Traditional methods for predicting urban building energy consumption levels face significant limitations in measuring the form  of the urban block environment. Leading to a lack of understanding of  the process of co-action of different dimensional environmental  elements on building energy consumption. In this study, a multimodal  deep learning framework is proposed to comprehensively capture the  environmental characteristics of real urban blocks by integrating  multidimensional environmental image data and morphological feature  form data to support a more scientific prediction of block energy  consumption levels. Based on this, the multimodal dataset with the best  prediction performance is derived from the deep learning model  analysis experiments with multiple spatial resolutions and different  dataset weighting ratios. Finally, the SHAP model for interpretable  machine learning and the Grad-CAM model to analyse the effect of  different block environmental features on energy consumption levels.  The predictive performance as well as the scientific validity of the  process explanation is validated with the publicly available energy  dataset of Manhattan. The framework offers valuable insights for urban  energy zoning, urban block design optimization, and energy-efficient  building retrofits.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
